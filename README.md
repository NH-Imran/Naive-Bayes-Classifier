# Naive Bayes Text Classification Using Bag of Words

Developed a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm in combination with the Bag of Words approach.
This project involved preprocessing textual data, creating a Bag of Words representation, and implementing a Naive Bayes classifier to predict categories of new text inputs. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved 98% accuracy.
